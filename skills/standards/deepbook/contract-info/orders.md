Users can create limit or market orders, modify orders, and cancel orders. The `BalanceManager` must have the necessary funds to process orders. DeepBookV3 has four order options and three self matching options. If you set the `pay_with_deep` flag to `true`, trading fees are paid with the DEEP token. If you set the `pay_with_deep` flag to `false`, trading fees are paid with the input token.

Users can modify their existing order, reducing the size, lowering the expiration time, or both. Users cannot modify their order to increase their size or increase their expiration time. To do that, they must cancel the original order and place a new order.

Users can cancel a single order or cancel all of their orders.

## API

Following are the order related endpoints that `Pool` exposes.

<summary>Order options</summary>

The following constants define the options available for orders.

<summary>Self-matching options</summary>

The following constants define the options available for self-matching orders.

<summary>OrderInfo struct</summary>

Placing a limit order or a market order creates and returns an `OrderInfo` object. DeepBookV3 automatically drops this object after the order completes or is placed in the book. Use `OrderInfo` to inspect the execution details of the request as it represents all order information. DeepBookV3 does not catch any errors, so if there's a failure of any kind, then the entire transaction fails.

<summary>`OrderDeepPrice` struct</summary>

The `OrderDeepPrice` struct represents the conversion rate of DEEP at the time the order was placed.

<summary>`Fill` struct</summary>

The `Fill` struct represents the results of a match between two orders. Use this struct to update the state.

<summary>Place limit order</summary>

Place a limit order. Quantity is in base asset terms. For current version `pay_with_deep` must be true, so the
fee is paid with DEEP tokens.

You must combine a `BalanceManager` call of generating a `TradeProof` before placing orders.

<summary>Place market order</summary>

Place a market order. Quantity is in base asset terms. Calls `place_limit_order` with a price of `MAX_PRICE` for bids and `MIN_PRICE` for asks. DeepBookV3 cancels the order for any quantity not filled.

<summary>Modify order</summary>

Modifies an order given `order_id` and `new_quantity`. New quantity must be less than the original quantity and more than the filled quantity. Order must not have already expired.

The `modify_order` function does not return anything. If the transaction is successful, then assume the modification was successful.

<summary>Cancel order</summary>

Cancel an order. The order must be owned by the `balance_manager`. The order is removed from the book and the `balance_manager` open orders. The `balance_manager` balance is updated with the order's remaining quantity.

Similar to modify, `cancel_order` does not return anything. DeepBookV3 emits `OrderCanceled` event.

<summary>Cancel multiple orders</summary>

Cancel multiple orders within a vector. The orders must be owned by the `balance_manager`. The orders are removed from the book and the `balance_manager` open orders. If any order fails to cancel, no orders will be cancelled (atomic operation).

<summary>Cancel all orders</summary>

Cancel all open orders placed by the balance manager in the pool. This is a convenience function that cancels every order associated with the balance manager.

<summary>Withdraw settled amounts</summary>

Withdraw settled amounts to the `balance_manager`. All orders automatically withdraw settled amounts. This can be called explicitly to withdraw all settled funds from the pool.

<summary>Withdraw settled amounts permissionless</summary>

Withdraw settled amounts to the `balance_manager` without requiring a `TradeProof`. This is a permissionless version that anyone can call to settle a balance manager's funds.

## Events

<summary>`OrderFilled`</summary>

Emitted when a maker order is filled.

<summary>`OrderCanceled`</summary>

Emitted when a maker order is canceled.

<summary>`OrderModified`</summary>

Emitted when a maker order is modified.

<summary>`OrderPlaced`</summary>

Emitted when a maker order is placed into the order book.
